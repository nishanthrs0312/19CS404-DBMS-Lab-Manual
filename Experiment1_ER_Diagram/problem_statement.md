## Objective
To understand and apply ER modeling concepts by creating ER diagrams for real-world applications.

## Purpose
Gain hands-on experience in designing ER diagrams that represent database structure including entities, relationships, attributes, and constraints.

| Entity | Attributes (PK, FK) | Notes |
|--------|--------------------|-------|
|MEMBER  |Member_ID (PK), Name, Membership_Type, Start_Date            |Tracks all gym members       |
|PROGRAM |Program_ID (PK), Program_Name, Type                          |Yoga, Zumba, Weight Training |
|TRAINER |Trainer_ID (PK), Name, Specialization                    |A trainer may take multiplE programs|
|SESSION |Session_ID (PK), Member_ID (FK), Trainer_ID (FK), Date, Time |For personal training sessions |
|ATTENDANCE|Attendance_ID (PK), Session_ID (FK), Status (Present/Absent)|Records session attendance   |


### Relationships and Constraints

| Relationship | Cardinality | Participation | Notes |

|Session–Attendance          |1:M |Partial|Each session must have attendance record       |

### Assumptions

Membership type determines allowed programs but not restricted in ER model. -Personal training sessions are optional. -Payments cover both membership fees and session fees.
